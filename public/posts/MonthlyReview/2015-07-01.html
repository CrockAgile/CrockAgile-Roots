        <h2>June Review</h2>
        <h5>by Jeffrey Crocker
        </h5>
      </div>
      <div class="section blog-section">
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m9"><p>I want to learn to get stuff <strong>done</strong>, and these reviews will help me
to do that. They help me keep perspective as time flies in my young adult
life. I can find what approaches work for me, and hold myself accountable
to goals and dreams.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>A recent episode of <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/">Hello Internet</a> recommended 
the reading of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143126563">Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free 
Productivity</a>. I am only
a few chapters into the book but thus far the techniques seem promising.
My main takeaway thus far has been to offload unfinished concerns to
a trusted system. I personally use <a href="http://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>
as my trusted external system, and I already feel less stressed. 
But in all fairness, this may also be because I am temporarily an 
employed college graduate with minimal responsibilities!</p>
<p>A new process I am experimenting with is assigning myself weekly educational
materials, generally with one per day. Thus far I am enjoying the new policy.
I constantly stumble upon interesting posts or projects online and 
save them for later. The problem in the past was that whenever I 
looked at the mound of projects awaiting me, it was quite daunting.
Now I am more selective with what I add to the queue, and simply chip
away at the pile every day or so. This new approach is already yielding
results, and below is a list of some of my favorite recent discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Experiences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> - A community for 
learning web development, building a portfolio, and helping nonprofit
organizatins. I have thus far been very impressed with freecodecamp,
and I am not the only one. Freecodecamp was also featured in <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/can-real-world-work-free-coding-boot-camp/">Wired 
Magazine</a> 
and <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-more-places-to-learn-to-code-for-free.html">Inc. Magazine</a> 
as one of the places to learn to code.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu">JSConf</a> - Although I could 
not attend in person (maybe someday!) JSConf US did upload some 
inciteful and engaging presentations.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/dreamweaver/2015/06/the-state-of-svg-animation.html">State of SVG Animation</a> -
Before reading this fine article I was completely ignorant to the 
world of animating SVGs beyond the most basic CSS properties.
After reading it, I still have much to learn and try, but knowing what
I don&#39;t know is progress!</li>
<li><a href="http://nodeschool.io/">Nodeschool</a> -
Nodeschool is a well-known name in JS &amp; Node education, but I had simply
never explored further than their home page. This month I discovered
that was a major mistake. Nodeschool offers a wide variety of core and
elective workshops including JS &amp; Node basics, ES6, React, Web Audio, and Graphics.            </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-past">The Past</h4>
<p><strong>Successes of June</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Website Launched! Rather than eternally polishing it to perfection,
I finally accepted that having a functional site is better than nothing. 
Having the site up and running is certainly motivating.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thefabulous.co/">The Fabulous Phone App</a> is a bit cheesy 
at times, but in the end my morning routine is much improved, and 
there were noticeable health and well-being benefits.</li>
<li>Assigning weekly tasks felt feasible and valuable, two core aspects
of any good task. I will make sure to continue the approach, but should
probably be more selective as to what I put in the queue.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.runrocknroll.com/seattle/">Rock&#39;N&#39;Roll Seattle Half-Marathon</a>
may have been a life changing experience. I know now that running can 
be a healthy part of my lifestyle and I don&#39;t intend to slow down 
(except for the week I took off After the big day).</li>
<li>I unsubscribed from all podcasts that I had not listened to in the
month. They all sound interesting but I have to accept that I have to
be more selective.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215151/">Inequality for All</a> is an
engaging documentary about U.S. labor economics. Although I do not
agree with every analysis, it certainly was high quality and the
presentation style and infographics were inspiring design elements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Road Bumps of June</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuts. I don&#39;t know if I am developing an allergy or intolerance,
but lately nuts have been making me sick. Stop eating them!</li>
<li>Running is good, but I can&#39;t keep neglecting my core strength.</li>
<li>Despite being back in the Seattle area, I have not been making enough time
for friends and family.</li>
<li>Losing socks. I keep losing so many socks in the laundry process,
it is getting comically ridiculous.</li>
<li>Occasionally I allow media to interrupt my morning routine. This
cannot continue!</li>
<li>Relied upon family a bit too heavily for home cooked meals and 
took for granted.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-future">The Future</h4>
<p><strong>Improvements for July</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will not do anything (within reason) until I have completed my
morning routine.</li>
<li>Watch another documentary.</li>
<li>Walk / run 5k everyday!</li>
<li>Core body weight workout everyday!</li>
<li>Wash socks separately and don&#39;t let mix in big pile.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don&#39;t Know JS</a> 
book series and take notes.</li>
<li>Update resume as web element.</li>
<li>Apply for 3 New Positions.</li>
<li>Create complex Angular app (DOTA related?).</li>
<li>Cook a new meal every Friday.</li>
</ul>
